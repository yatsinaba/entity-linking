If the Earnout Product is sold independently of the Other Products in the Territory, but the public or list price of the Other Products cannot be determined, Net Sales will be calculated by multiplying the total Net Sales (as described above) of such Combination Product by the fraction A/C, where A is the public or list price in the Territory of such Earnout Product sold independently and C is the public or list price in the Territory of the Combination Product.
iii.        
If the Other Products are sold independently of the Earnout Product in the Territory, but the public or list price of such Earnout Product cannot be determined, Net Sales will be calculated by multiplying the total Net Sales (as described above) of such Combination Product by the fraction 1-B/C, where B is the sum of the public or list prices in the Territory of the Other Products and C is the public or list price in such country of the Combination Product.

7.6       Confidential Information.
7.6.1    Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and information provided pursuant to this Agreement shall remain subject to the Confidentiality Agreement; provided,  however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer and/or Seller may make any disclosure to the extent it is required to do so to comply with any Laws, subject to Section 7.6.2 below.
7.6.2    
From and after the Closing, each Party shall treat and hold as confidential, and not use or disclose any of the Confidential Information to any Person, except to pursue its rights under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or as required to comply with any Laws.  
In the event that a Party is requested or required by oral question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process or as otherwise required by Law to disclose any Confidential Information, such disclosing Party shall notify the other Party promptly of the request or requirement so that the non-disclosing Party may seek, at its expense, an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 7.6.2.  
If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder a Party is compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to any Governmental Authority or else
stand liable for contempt, such Party may disclose the Confidential Information to the Governmental Authority; provided,  however, that (a) the disclosing Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request and expense of the other Party, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed as the other Party shall designate, and (b) the disclosing Party shall only disclose such Confidential Information as is required by such Governmental Authority.  
For the purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” from and
after the Closing shall mean (a) with respect to Buyer, any nonpublic or confidential information relating to the Transferred Assets, except to the extent that such information shall have become public knowledge other than through improper disclosure by Seller and (b) with respect to Seller, any nonpublic or confidential information relating to the Excluded Assets or the Retained Liabilities.  
For clarity, the terms of this Agreement shall be the Confidential Information of each Party, and subject to Section 7.7, neither Party may disclose the terms of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party.
7.6.3    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in the Confidentiality Agreement, with respect to any claim related to a breach or threatened breach of the Confidentiality Agreement or this Section 7.6.3, each Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce the provisions thereof and hereof, in addition to such other remedies to which such Party may be entitled, including the recovery of money damages.

The Parties agree to waive compliance with the provisions of any so-called “bulk transfer law,
” “bulk sales law,” or any similar Tax Law (including any Tax clearance or certification of Tax compliance Law) of any jurisdiction that may be applicable with respect to the sale of the Transferred Assets as contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve Seller from its obligation to indemnify Buyer in accordance with ARTICLE 8 for any Taxes that are Retained Taxes.
7.8.2    Transfer Taxes.  
All Transfer Taxes shall be borne and paid by Buyer when due.  
Buyer shall, at its own expense, timely file any Tax Return or other document with respect to such Transfer Taxes (and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with respect thereto as necessary).
7.8.3    Other Taxes.  
In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any property, ad valorem or similar Taxes in respect of the Transferred Assets apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall equal an amount that bears the same ratio to the aggregate amount of such Tax in respect of the entire Straddle Period as the number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period bears to the number of days in the entire applicable Straddle Period and in the case of any other Taxes, the amount in respect of the Transferred Assets allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the end of the day on the Closing Date.
7.8.4    Withholding Taxes.
(a)        
Any and all payments due by Buyer hereunder (or its permitted successors or assigns) to Seller shall be made without set off and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes (subject to Section 7.8.4), except to the extent for Taxes subject to withholding as required by Law, provided, that Buyer shall give Seller reasonable advance written notice at least [
*
**] prior to the date such payment is due hereunder of any anticipated deduction or withholding and setting forth the basis in Law for such withholding.
To the extent any such amounts are deducted or withheld, Buyer shall pay the amount of such Taxes to the proper Governmental Authority when due and promptly transmit to Seller an official Tax certificate or other evidence of such Tax obligations, together with proof of payment from the relevant Governmental Authority of all amounts deducted and withheld as allowed hereunder sufficient to enable Seller to claim payment of such Taxes.  
Any withholding Taxes required by Law to be paid or withheld pursuant to this Section 7.8.4(a) shall be an expense of, and borne solely by, Seller, and to the extent withheld by Buyer, shall be deemed to have been paid by the Buyer to the Seller under this Agreement.  
Upon the reasonable request of Seller, Buyer shall provide reasonable assistance to Seller to enable Seller to recover such Taxes as permitted by applicable Law at Seller’s expense for any out-of-pocket Third Party costs incurred by Buyer in providing such assistance.  
The Parties shall reasonably cooperate to minimize any such withholding Taxes.

had not occurred, then Buyer may withhold such Taxes and any amount payable by Buyer to

Seller hereunder shall be increased to take into account such excess withholding Taxes as may be necessary so that, after making all required withholding, Seller receives an amount it would have received
had the state of affairs described in clause (i) not occurred; provided,  however, that, to the extent that the state of affairs described in clause (i) occurs (
determined by substituting “Seller” for all references to “Buyer” in clause (i)), and the additional amounts otherwise required to be paid by Buyer to Seller pursuant to this Section 7.8.4(b) would be lower or eliminated if the state of affairs in clause (i) had not occurred (determined by substituting “Seller” for all references to “Buyer” in clause (i)), Buyer shall be required to pay only such additional amounts as Buyer would be required to pay if the state of affairs in clause (i) had not occurred (determined by substituting “Seller” for all references to “Buyer” in clause (i)).  
Any such increased amount payable to Seller under this Section 7.8.4(b) shall be net of any withholding tax credits (including, for clarity, foreign tax credits) utilized by Seller to offset otherwise payable Taxes with respect to the taxable year in which such payment occurs (as reasonably determined in good faith by Seller).
In addition, to the extent that Seller obtains a Tax refund for a Tax in respect of which it received an additional payment pursuant to this Section 7.8.4(b), then Seller shall promptly return such refund to Buyer (not to exceed the amount actually received by Seller for such Tax pursuant to this Section 7.8.4(b)), net of any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such refund, provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing clause shall be interpreted as requiring Seller to provide Buyer with a copy of its Tax Returns.
7.9       Post-Closing Information.  
Each of Buyer and Seller agrees to, after the Closing, subject to compliance with applicable Laws and any established legal privilege, reasonably cooperate with the other Party and any of the other Party’s Affiliates in connection with the defense by Buyer or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates against any Action or Proceeding related to the Transferred Assets, RHOFADE Licensed Patents or the RHOFADE Business (other than any proceeding between Buyer and Seller), or to enable the other Party and its representatives to satisfy its and its Affiliates’ financial reporting, audit and Tax preparation obligations.  
Seller shall be responsible for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Buyer and its Affiliates incurred in connection with Buyer’s reasonable cooperation with Seller pursuant to this Section 7.9 to the extent such Action or Proceeding or investigation relates to conduct in connection with the RHOFADE Business on or after November 30, 2018 and prior to the Closing or the conduct of Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective employees or contractors post-Closing, and Buyer shall be responsible for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Seller and its Affiliates incurred in connection with Seller’s reasonable cooperation with Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.9 to the extent
such Action or Proceeding or investigation relates to conduct in connection with the RHOFADE Business post-Closing.

8.4.1    
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a)
neither Party shall be liable for indemnification for indemnifiable Losses pursuant to Section 8.2.1 or Section 8.3.1, as applicable, for any individual Loss or series of related Losses unless the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses for which such Party would be liable thereunder exceeds [
*
*
*] Dollars ($
[***]) (the “Deductible”), after which such Party shall be liable for the amount only in excess of the Deductible, and (b) each Party’s aggregate Liability for indemnification for indemnifiable Losses pursuant to Section 8.2.1 or Section 8.3.1, as applicable, shall not exceed [
*
*
*] Dollars ($[
***])  (the “Cap”); provided,  however, that the Deductible and the Cap shall not apply to limit any Party’s Liability for indemnifiable Losses arising out of such Party’s fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or breach of the Fundamental Representations, provided that for any breach of the Fundamental Representations not due to the breaching Party’s fraud or intentional misrepresentation, each Party’s aggregate Liability shall not exceed the sum of the Upfront Payment, the Sales Milestones payments, the Royalty payments, and the Additional Ex-U.S. Consideration actually paid to Seller hereunder.  
For the avoidance of doubt, none of the limitations in this Section 8.4.1 shall apply in the case of claims made pursuant to Sections 8.2.2 through 8.2.4, or Sections 8.3.2 and 8.3.3.
8.4.2    With respect to any Losses, each Party seeking indemnification shall, in good faith, use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such Losses to the extent required by applicable Law.
8.4.3    The amount of any Losses payable under this ARTICLE 8 shall be reduced by the net amount of any insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party to the extent resulting from such Losses or any net amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates from any other Third Party (after taking into account the costs of any such recovery) (each, “Recovery”), after upward adjustment for any additional Taxes owed as a result of receipt of any indemnification for such Losses.  
In the event that any such Recovery is received by an Indemnified Party after payment of an indemnity claim for Losses by an indemnified Person hereunder, such indemnified Person shall promptly pay the amount of such Recovery to the Indemnifying Party.  
No Indemnified Party shall have any obligation to pursue any Recovery, other than as required by Section 8.4.2.
8.4.4    
Buyer shall have the right to setoff indemnifiable Losses hereunder against the Sales Milestone payments, the Royalty payments, and/or any Additional Ex-U.S. Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1.2(a),  Section 3.1.2(c), and Section 3.1.3, respectively, that are unpaid and may become due at any time after the Closing Date.  
If on the date any such payment is due to Seller, Buyer has provided an Indemnification Claim Notice to Seller in accordance with Section 8.5 for indemnification under Section 8.2 hereof that has not been paid by Seller, and Seller has not disputed the amount or validity of the claim in accordance with Section 8.5 hereof, then Buyer may setoff the amount of the indemnifiable Loss dollar for dollar against the payment due to Seller under Section 3.1.2(a),  Section 3.1.2(c), or Section 3.1.3.  
If on the date any such payment is due to Seller, Buyer has provided an Indemnification Claim Notice to Seller in accordance with Section 8.5 for indemnification under Section 8.2 hereof that is disputed by Seller and any dispute with respect to such claim has not, by such date, been finally resolved in

Upon resolution of the applicable dispute, the Parties shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent to disburse amounts in escrow in accordance with such resolution.

8.5       Notice of Claim.  
All indemnification claims in respect of any indemnitee seeking indemnity under Sections 8.2 and 8.3 (collectively, the “Indemnitees” and each an “Indemnitee”) will be made solely by the corresponding Party (the “Indemnified Party”).  
The Indemnified Party will give the Party from whom indemnity is being sought (the “Indemnifying Party”)
prompt written notice (an “Indemnification Claim Notice”) of any Losses or the discovery of any fact upon which such Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification under Sections 8.2 or 8.3, as applicable, but in no event will the Indemnifying Party be liable for any Losses that result from any delay in providing such notice which materially and actually prejudices the defense of such claim.  
Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and the nature and amount of Losses (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Losses are known at such time).  
Together with the Indemnification Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party will furnish promptly to the Indemnifying Party copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by any Indemnitee in connection with the claim.  
A failure by the Indemnified Party to give notice of the claim as required by this Section 8.5 shall not limit the obligation of the Indemnifying Party under this ARTICLE 8, except (a) to the extent any admission or statement made by the Indemnified Party materially prejudices the defense of such claim and (b) as provided in Section 8.1.  
The Indemnifying Party shall reply to an Indemnification Claim Notice by providing written notice to the Indemnitee as to whether the Indemnifying Party agrees or disagrees that the claim asserted is a valid claim for indemnification hereunder and agrees or disagrees as to the amount of the Losses in such Indemnification Claim Notice.  
If the Indemnifying Party does not dispute the validity of the claim and the amount of the Losses asserted in the Indemnification Claim Notice, then the Indemnifying Party shall pay the claimed amount of the Losses within [*
**] of receipt of the Indemnification Claim Notice.  
If the Indemnifying Party disagrees with the validity of the claim or the amount of the Losses in the Indemnification Claim

Notice, then the claim will be considered a disputed claim to be resolved by the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Article 8 and Section 9.2 hereof.
8.6       Control of Defense.
8.6.1    
At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any claim made by, or any Action or Proceeding commenced by, a Third Party (a “Third Party Claim”) by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within [
***]
after the Indemnifying Party’s receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice; provided that the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing that the Losses resulting from such Third Party Claim are within the scope of indemnified Losses subject to Section 8.2, in the case of Seller as the Indemnifying Party, or Section 8.3, in the case of Buyer as the Indemnifying Party; provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to (a) assume the defense, appeal or settlement of any Third Party Claim if (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation or (ii)
the Third Party Claim seeks any injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; or (b) maintain control of the defense, appeal or settlement of any Third Party Claim if the Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to defend in good faith the Third Party Claim.  
Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of the Third Party Claim any legal counsel that is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party and shall be responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the defense of such Third Party Claim.  
Should the Indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not, except as provided in Sections 8.7 and 8.8 below, be liable to the Indemnified Party or any other Indemnitee for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party or other Indemnitee in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim.
8.6.2    If the Indemnifying Party is entitled to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.6.1, but is not prepared to acknowledge in writing that the Losses resulting from such Third Party Claim are within the scope of indemnified Losses subject to Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, as applicable, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall jointly control the defense, appeal and settlement of the Third Party Claim.  
In such instance, (a) defense counsel for the Third Party Claim shall be jointly appointed by the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, and the costs of defense (including the fees and expenses of such jointly appointed counsel) shall be borne equally by the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, regardless of which party initially pays such costs, (b) no material decision or action in the defense of the Third Party Claim shall be taken and no settlement or compromise of such Third Party Claim shall be entered into or agreed to, in each case, without the prior consent of each of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (such consent to not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and
(c) each of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in, but not control, the joint defense through its own independent counsel, at its own expense.  
In the event that the Indemnifying Party subsequently assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.6.1, then the Indemnifying Party shall become responsible for (and reimburse the Indemnified Party as applicable)
all costs of the joint defense contemplated by clause (a) of the preceding sentence.  
If it is ultimately determined that the Third Party Claim is not indemnifiable under this ARTICLE 8, then the Indemnified Party shall become responsible for

[

(and reimburse the Indemnifying Party as applicable)
all costs of the joint defense contemplated by clause (a) of this Section 8.6.2.
8.7       Right to Participate in Defense.  
Without limiting Section 8.6.1, any Indemnitee will be entitled to participate in, but not control, the defense of a claim for which it has sought indemnification hereunder and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided,  however, that such employment will be at the Indemnitee’s own expense unless (a) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, (b) at any point the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel in accordance with Section 8.6 (in which case the Indemnified Party will control the defense) or (c)
if the interests of the Indemnified Party and the Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as applicable, on the one hand, and the Indemnifying Party, on the other hand, with respect to the Third Party Claim are sufficiently adverse to prohibit the representation by the same counsel of both parties under applicable Law, ethical rules or equitable principles.
8.8       Settlement.  
With respect to any Losses relating solely to the payment of money in connection with a Third Party Claim and that will not result in the Indemnitee’s becoming subject to injunctive or other relief or otherwise adversely affect the business of the Indemnitee in any manner, and as to which the Indemnifying Party will have acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder and in the event the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.6.1, the Indemnifying Party will have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of a Third Party Claim, on such terms as the Indemnifying Party, in its reasonable discretion, will deem appropriate (provided,  however, that such terms shall include a complete and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all Liability with respect thereto), and will transfer to the Indemnified Party all amounts which said Indemnified Party will be liable to pay prior to the time of the entry of judgment.  
With respect to all other Third Party Claims where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the claim in accordance with Section 8.6.1, the Indemnifying Party will not have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such claims unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld by the Indemnified Party).  
The Indemnifying Party that has assumed the defense of the claim in accordance with Section 8.6 will not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a loss by an Indemnitee that is reached without the prior written consent of such Indemnifying Party.  
Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses or is entitled to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, no Indemnitee will admit any Liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld by the Indemnifying Party).
8.9       Cooperation.  
Each Party and each Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as applicable, shall reasonably cooperate in good faith with respect to the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and will furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection with such Third Party Claim.  
Such cooperation will include, upon written request of the Indemnifying Party, access during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of,

8.10     Calculation of Losses.  
With respect to any representation and warranty contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document that is qualified by materiality, “Material Adverse Effect” or a derivative thereof, such qualification will be ignored and deemed not included in such representation or warranty for the purposes of (a) calculating the amount of Losses indemnifiable under this ARTICLE 8 with respect to such breach or inaccuracy
and (b) determining whether there has been a breach or inaccuracy of such representation or warranty for purposes of this ARTICLE 8.
8.11     Escrow Account.  
From and after the Closing, any indemnification to which any Buyer Indemnitee is entitled under Section 8.2 shall be first satisfied by recouping all of such Losses from the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement until the Escrow Amount is exhausted or released pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.
If the Escrow Amount is not sufficient to pay the entire amount of the Losses, such Buyer Indemnitee shall have all other rights and remedies available to it pursuant to this Agreement to recover the remaining amount directly from Seller.
Following the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release any remaining Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.
8.12     Sole Remedies.  
The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that except as provided in Section 7.6.3 and Section 9.10, and for claims based on an act of fraud, the indemnification provisions of this ARTICLE 8 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any item that is covered by such indemnification provisions.
For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification rights in Sections 8.2 and 8.3, subject to the limitations of this Agreement, shall apply to Third Party Claims as well as to disputes between the Parties.
8.13     Allocation of Indemnification Payments.  
Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the Parties hereto agree that any indemnification payment pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be allocated as set forth in Section 3.4.2.
8.14     Subrogation.  
Upon making any payment to an Indemnitee in respect of any Losses under this ARTICLE 8, the Indemnifying Party shall, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee and its Affiliates against any Third Party in respect of the Losses to which such payment relates.  
Such Indemnitee and its Affiliates and the Indemnifying Party shall execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence or further perfect such subrogation rights.
