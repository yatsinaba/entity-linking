(v)
the Purchaser shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to $500,000 (the “Representative Expense Amount”), for the Stockholder Representative to hold in the Representative Expense Account and disburse in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
1.12 Post-Closing Adjustment.
(a)
As promptly as possible, but in any event within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will deliver to the Stockholder Representative (
i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies (the “Closing Balance Sheet”)
as of the Calculation Time, and (ii) a statement showing the calculation of (A) the amount of Cash derived from the Closing Balance Sheet as of the Calculation Time, (B) the amount of Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the Closing, (C) the Net Working Capital derived from the Closing Balance Sheet as of the Calculation Time, and (D) the amount of Transaction Expenses unpaid as of the Closing (together with the Closing Balance Sheet, the “Preliminary Statement”).
The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared on a consolidated basis in accordance with the Closing Accounting Principles, and shall not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions contemplated hereby.
The parties hereto agree that the calculation of the Closing Balance Sheet and Net Working Capital is not intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies that are inconsistent with the 2018 Financial Statements.
After delivery of the Preliminary Statement, the Stockholder Representative and its accountants shall be permitted reasonable access (upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours) to review the Acquired Companies’ books and records and work papers related to the preparation of the Preliminary Statement.
The Stockholder Representative and its accountants may make inquiries of the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and their respective accountants regarding questions concerning, or disagreements with, the Preliminary Statement arising in the course of their review thereof, and the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, cause any such accountants to reasonably cooperate with and timely respond to such inquiries.
(b)
If the Purchaser fails to timely deliver a Preliminary Statement in accordance with Section 1.12(a), then the Estimated Closing Statement shall be deemed to be the Preliminary Statement and the Stockholder Representative may deliver an Objections Statement with respect thereto in accordance with this Section 1.12(b).
If the Stockholder Representative has any objections to the Preliminary Statement, the Stockholder Representative shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement setting forth its objections thereto (an “Objections Statement”).
If an Objections Statement is not delivered to the Purchaser within forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Preliminary Statement, then the Preliminary Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto.
The Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections, but if they do not reach a final resolution within forty-five (45) days after the delivery of the Objections Statement, the Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser shall submit such dispute to RSM US LLP (“RSM”); provided that, if RSM is unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, the Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser shall jointly select an alternative arbiter from a nationally recognized independent public accounting firm that is not the independent auditor of the Purchaser, the Stockholder
 
6 

Representative or any Acquired Company (RSM or the Person so selected, as applicable, the “Dispute Resolution Auditor”).
Each of the Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser may furnish to the Dispute Resolution Auditor such information and documents as it deems relevant, with copies of such submission and all such documents and information being concurrently given to the other party.
The Dispute Resolution Auditor shall consider only those items and amounts which are identified in the Objections Statement as being items which the Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser are unable to resolve.
The Dispute Resolution Auditor’s determination will be based solely on the definitions of Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses contained herein and the Closing Accounting Principles.
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall request that the Dispute Resolution Auditor render a determination as to each unresolved item identified in the Objections statement within thirty (30) days after its retention.
The Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 408 shall apply with respect to any communications and other correspondence during the 45-day period after the Purchaser’s delivery of the Preliminary Statement to the Stockholder Representative and any subsequent communications related to the Preliminary Statement or the Objections Statement following therefrom.
The Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution Auditor to resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable.
Further, the Dispute Resolution Auditor’s determination shall be based solely on the supporting material provided by the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative in accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review) and may not assign a value to any particular item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by either party, in each case as presented to the Dispute Resolution Auditor.
Absent fraud or manifest error, the resolution of the dispute by the Dispute Resolution Auditor shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the parties hereto.
The costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Auditor shall be allocated between the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Stockholders, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party.
For example, if the Stockholder Representative claims the Net Working Capital is $1,000 greater than the amount determined by the Purchaser
’s accountants, the Purchaser contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the Stockholder Representative, and the Dispute Resolution Auditor ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Stockholders $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Auditor will be allocated 60% (i.e., $300 ÷ $500) to the Purchaser and 40% (i.e., $200 ÷ $500) to the Stockholders.
The amount of Cash as of the Calculation Time, the amount of Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the Closing, the Net Working Capital as of the Calculation Time and the amount of Transaction Expenses unpaid as of the Closing, in each case as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.12(b), shall be referred to herein as the “Final Cash,” the “Final Indebtedness,” the “Final Net Working Capital” and the “Final Transaction Expenses.”
(c)
If, after final determination of the Final Cash, the Final Indebtedness, the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Transaction Expenses pursuant to Section 1.12(b), the Estimated Closing Merger Consideration is less than the Closing Merger Consideration (such shortfall, the “Shortfall Amount”), then within two (2) Business Days after the Final Cash, the Final Indebtedness, the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Transaction Expenses become final and binding on the parties hereto pursuant to Section 1.12(b):
(i) the Purchaser shall pay to the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of, and for further distribution to, the Stockholders), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Stockholders’ portion of the Shortfall Amount (as directed by the Stockholder Representative in accordance with Section 1.10(c)); and
 
7 

(ii)
the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Adjustment Escrow Account within two (2) Business Days after delivery of such joint written instruction, to the Stockholder Representative
(on behalf of, and for further distribution to, the Stockholders), the Stockholders’ portion of the remaining funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account (as directed by the Stockholder Representative in accordance with Section 1.10(c)).
(d)
If, after final determination of the Final Cash, the Final Indebtedness, the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Transaction Expenses pursuant to Section 1.12(b), the Estimated Closing Merger Consideration is greater than the Closing Merger Consideration (such excess, the “Excess Amount”), then within two (2) Business Days after the Final Cash, the Final Indebtedness, the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Transaction Expenses become final and binding on the parties hereto pursuant to Section 1.12(b), the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Adjustment Escrow Account within two (2) Business Days after delivery of such joint written instruction:
(i) to the Purchaser, the lesser of (A) the Excess Amount and (B) the remaining funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account; and
(ii) to the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of, and for further distribution to, the Stockholders), the Stockholders’ portion of the remaining funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account (if any) after the payment to the Purchaser described in Section 1.12(d)(i)
(as directed by the Stockholder Representative in accordance with Section 1.10(c)).
(e)
In the event that an Excess Amount is due to Purchaser and the Adjustment Escrow Amount is insufficient to satisfy payment of the entire Excess Amount due to Purchaser in full, then within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Excess Amount, the Stockholder Representative shall pay, on behalf of the Stockholders, to Purchaser, an amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to such deficiency.
(f)
The Purchaser, Stockholders and Stockholder Representative agree that the adjustment to the Estimated Closing Merger Consideration provided for in this Section 1.12, and the dispute resolution provisions provided for in this Section 1.12, shall be the exclusive remedies for the matters addressed or that could be addressed by this Section 1.12.
1.13 Deliveries at Closing.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto shall consummate the following transactions at the Closing:
(a) the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser an affidavit dated as of the Closing Date, duly executed under penalties of perjury and otherwise in form and substance as required under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.445-2(e), certifying that it is not a United States real property holding corporation;

7.02 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.
(a)
For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any Acquired Company to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in such Acquired Company’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws, certificate of formation or limited liability company agreement (or equivalent governing document) relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any current or former managers, directors and/or officers of each Acquired Company (each such individual, a “D&O Indemnitee”) from the form of such provisions as of immediately prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger (unless required by Law), it being the intent of the parties
hereto that the D&O Indemnitees shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by Law.
(b)
In addition to the other rights provided for in this Section 7.02, and not in limitation thereof, from and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, cause each Acquired Company to: (i) indemnify and hold harmless (and release from any liability to the Purchaser or any Acquired Company)
each D&O Indemnitee against all D&O Expenses and all losses, liabilities, damages, expenses, claims, judgments or amounts paid in settlement (collectively, “D&O Costs”)
in respect of any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, based on, arising out of or relating to the fact that such D&O Indemnitee is or was a manager, director or officer of any Acquired Company and arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing (a “D&O Indemnifiable Claim”); provided, however, that D&O Indemnifiable Claims shall not include any claim that is finally adjudicated in a manner that determines that such D&O Indemnitee is not entitled to such indemnification under applicable Law or any of the Acquired Companies’ certificates of incorporation, bylaws, certificates of formation or limited liability company agreements (or equivalent governing documents); and (ii) advance to each D&O Indemnitee
all D&O Expenses incurred by such D&O Indemnitee (including in circumstances where the applicable Acquired Company has assumed the defense of such claim); provided, however, that the D&O Indemnitee to whom D&O Expenses are to be advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such D&O Indemnitee is not entitled to such indemnification under applicable Law or any of the Acquired Companies’ certificate of incorporation, bylaws, certificate of formation or limited liability company agreement (or equivalent governing documents).
Any D&O Indemnifiable Claim shall continue until such D&O Indemnifiable Claim is disposed of or all judgments, orders, decrees or other rulings in connection with such D&O Indemnifiable Claim are fully satisfied.
For purposes of this Section 7.02(b), “D&O Expenses” means attorneys’ fees and all other reasonable costs, charges and expenses paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in, any D&O Indemnifiable Claim, but shall exclude losses, liabilities, damages, expenses, judgments and amounts paid in settlement (which items are included in the definition of D&O Costs).

ARTICLE 10
SPECIFIED WARRANTY CLAIM INDEMNIFICATION
10.01 Specified Warranty Claim Indemnification.
(a) Indemnification of the Purchaser by the Stockholders.
The Stockholders shall, subject to the terms, conditions and express limitations provided in this Article 10, jointly and severally indemnify the Purchaser and its Affiliates, members, equity holders, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the “Purchaser Parties”) and save and hold each of them harmless against, and pay on behalf of or reimburse such Purchaser Parties as and when incurred, any loss, liability, demand, claim, action, cause of action, cost, damage (including punitive damages, but solely to the extent payable to a third party), deficiency, penalty, fine or expense, whether or not arising out of third-party claims (including but not limited to interest, penalties, reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees and expenses and all amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement of any of the foregoing)
(collectively, “Losses”) which any such Purchaser Party may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as a result of, in connection with, or relating to any product warranty matters described on Schedule 10.01(a)
(each, a “Specified Warranty Claim”).
(b) Limitations on Indemnification.
(i)
The first $500,000 of Losses pursuant to Section 10.01(a) shall be paid from the Specified Warranty Claim Account; the next $500,000 of Losses pursuant to Section 10.01(a)
shall be shared equally between and paid equally by the Purchaser Parties, on the one hand, and (solely through payments from the Specified Warranty Claim Account)
the Stockholders, on the other hand; and the next $750,000 of Losses pursuant to Section 10.01(a) shall be paid from the Specified Warranty Claim Account.
By means of example and illustration, assuming that the Stockholders indemnify the Purchaser Parties for $500,000 of Losses from the Specified Warranty Claim Account, and a claim for $600,000 is subsequently submitted in accordance with the terms of this Article 10, then the Purchaser Parties would be entitled to receive $350,000 of Losses from the Specified Warranty Claim Account in respect of such subsequent $600,000 claim (i.e., fifty percent (50%) multiplied by the first $500,000 of the total $600,000 of Losses arising from such subsequent $600,000 claim (or $250,000), plus the remaining $100,000 portion of the total $600,000 of Losses (since that remaining $100,000 portion is in excess of $1,000,000 in total Losses pursuant to Section 10.01(a)).
(ii)
The Stockholders shall not be required to indemnify any Purchaser Party pursuant to, and shall not have any further liability under, Section 10.01(a) once the aggregate amount of all payments made by or on behalf of the Stockholders in respect of the indemnification obligations under Section 10.01(a) reaches $1,500,000 (the “Cap”);
provided that this Section 10.01(b)(ii) shall not apply to any Losses based on Actual Fraud.
 
44 

(iii)
The sole and exclusive source of payment for a claim by any Purchaser Party under Section 10.01(a) shall be limited to, and in no event shall the Stockholders’ aggregate liability under Section 10.01(a) exceed, the amount remaining in the Specified Warranty Claim Account from time to time, and no Purchaser Party shall seek recourse against any other assets of any Stockholder for any such claim; provided that this Section 10.01(b)(iii) shall not apply to any Losses based on Actual Fraud.
(iv)
The indemnification obligations of the Stockholders set forth in this Article 10 shall survive the Closing and shall terminate at 11:59 p.m.
Central time on the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Closing Date (the “Indemnity Survival Period”)
; provided that any indemnification obligation that would otherwise terminate in accordance with the foregoing shall survive and continue in full force and effect if a written notice shall have been timely given under this Article 10 prior to the expiration of the Indemnity Survival Period, until the related claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in this Article 10.
(v)
The Purchaser shall cause each Purchaser Party to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that may be indemnifiable hereunder.
(vi)
The Purchaser Parties shall not be entitled under this Agreement to recover from any unaffiliated third party (including the Stockholders) for the same Losses more than once.
(c) Indemnification Procedure.
If the Purchaser makes a claim, on behalf of itself or any Purchaser Party, for indemnification under this Article 10 (the “Indemnitee”), it shall notify the Stockholder Representative (the “Indemnitor”) of the claim in writing promptly after receiving written notice of any Proceeding against it (if by a third party) or discovering the liability, obligation or facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification, which notice shall describe the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof.
With respect to any third-party claim, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to assume control of the defense of such Proceeding giving rise to an Indemnitee’s claim for indemnification; provided that:
(i) the Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitor;
(ii)
the Indemnitor shall be entitled to assume control of such defense and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnitor if upon petition by the Indemnitor, the appropriate court rules that the Indemnitee failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim; and
(iii)
if the Indemnitee shall control the defense of any such claim, the Indemnitee shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim.
 
45
