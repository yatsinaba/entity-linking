make the Company’s independent accountants available for any such managing underwriters’ due diligence; provided, however, that such records and other information shall be subject to such confidential treatment as is customary for underwriters’ due diligence reviews; and provided, further, that, unless the disclosure of such records is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in the Registration Statement or otherwise to comply with federal securities laws or the release of such records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be required to provide any information under this subparagraph (viii) if (1) the Company believes, after consultation with counsel for the Company, that to do so would cause the Company to forfeit an attorney-client privilege that was applicable to such information or (2) if either (x) 
the Company has requested and been granted from the SEC confidential treatment of such information contained in any filing with the SEC or documents provided supplementally or otherwise
or (y) the Company reasonably determines in good faith that such records are confidential and so notifies the Persons requesting the records in writing unless prior to furnishing any such information with respect to (1) or (2) such Person requesting such information agrees to enter into a confidentiality agreement in customary form and subject to customary exceptions; and provided, further, that each such Person agrees that it will, upon learning that disclosure of such records is sought in a court of competent jurisdiction, give notice to the Company and allow the Company, at its expense, to undertake appropriate action and to prevent disclosure of the records deemed confidential;
 
(ix)                      use reasonable best efforts to cause all such Registerable Securities to be listed on each securities exchange (if any) on which similar securities of the same class issued by the Company are then listed;
 
(x)                         provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such Registerable Securities not later than the effective date of such Registration Statement and, a reasonable time before any proposed sale of Registerable Securities pursuant to a Registration
 
12
 
Statement, provide the transfer agent with printed certificates for the Registerable Securities to be sold;
 
(xi)       make generally available to its security holders a consolidated earnings statement (which need not be audited) for a period of 12 months beginning after the effective date of the Registration Statement as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of such period, which earnings statement shall satisfy the requirements of an earnings statement under Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder, and which requirement will be deemed to be satisfied if the Company timely files complete and accurate information on Forms 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K under the Exchange Act; and
 
(xii)      
as promptly as practicable notify the Participating Holder(s) and the managing underwriters of any Underwritten Offering, if any:
 
(1)           when the Registration Statement, any pre-effective amendment, the Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed and, with respect to the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective;
 
(2)           of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for any additional information regarding any Participating Holder;
 
(3)           of the notification to the Company by the SEC of its initiation of any proceeding with respect to the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement; and
 
(4)           of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any Registerable Securities for sale under the applicable securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction; and
 
(xiii)     keep Holder
’s Counsel reasonably apprised as to the intention and progress of the Company with respect to any Registration Statement hereunder, including by providing Holder’s Counsel with copies of all written correspondence with the SEC in connection with any Registration Statement or Prospectus filed hereunder.
 
(b)  
The Company shall ensure that (i) no Registration Statement (including any amendments thereto) shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii) no Prospectus (including any supplements thereto) shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case, except for any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact made in reliance on and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Holder(s) or any underwriter or other distributor specifically for use therein.
 
13


 
(c)   
At all times after the Company has filed a Registration Statement with the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to continuously maintain in effect the Registration Statement for the relevant period required hereunder under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and to use reasonable best efforts to file all reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder, all to the extent required to enable the Holder(s) to be eligible to sell Registerable Securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
 
(d)  
The Company may require the Participating Holder(s) and each distributor of Registerable Securities as to which any registration is being effected to furnish to the Company any other information regarding such Person and the distribution of such securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request.
 
(e)   
The Company may prepare and deliver an issuer free-writing prospectus (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) in lieu of any supplement to a prospectus, and references herein to any “supplement” to a Prospectus shall include any such issuer free-writing prospectus.  
Neither any Participating Holder nor any other seller of Registerable Securities may use a free-writing prospectus to offer or sell any such shares without the Company’s prior written consent.
 
(f)   
It is understood and agreed that any failure of the Company to file a Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto or to cause any such document to become or remain effective or usable within or for any particular period of time as provided in this Agreement, due to reasons that are not reasonably within its control, or due to any refusal of the SEC to permit a Registration Statement or prospectus to become or remain effective or to be used because of unresolved SEC comments thereon (or on any documents incorporated therein by reference) despite the Company’s good faith and diligent efforts to resolve those comments, shall not be a breach of this Agreement.  
However, neither shall any such failure relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder to use reasonable best efforts to remedy such failure.
 
Section 9.              Registration Expenses.
 
(a)  The Company shall pay all customary fees and expenses incident to the Company’s performance of or compliance with this Agreement, including all registration and filing fees, fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws,  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fees, exchange listing fees, printing expenses, transfer agent’s and registrar’s fees, cost of distributing Prospectuses in preliminary and final form as well as any supplements thereto, and all reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel for all Wanda Holders, counsel for the Company and all independent certified public accountants and other Persons retained by the Company;
provided that Registration Expenses shall not include any underwriting discounts or commissions attributable to the sale of Registerable Securities (collectively, “Registration Expenses”).  
All underwriting discounts and commissions attributable to the sale of Registerable Securities shall be paid by the Holder(s) of the relevant Registerable Securities.
 
14


 
(b)  The obligation of the Company to pay all Registration Expenses shall apply irrespective of whether a registration, once properly demanded or requested, if applicable, becomes effective, is withdrawn or suspended, is converted to another form of registration and irrespective of when any of the foregoing shall occur; provided however, that Registration Expenses for any Registration Statement withdrawn solely at the request of the Participating Holders (unless withdrawn following commencement of a Suspension Period) shall be borne by such Participating Holders.
 
Section 10.            Registration Rights of Other Persons; Transfers of Rights.
 
(a)  Superior Registration Rights.  
The Company shall not grant to any Person with respect to any equity securities of the Company, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity securities of the Company, registration rights that have terms more favorable than the registration rights granted to Wanda in this Agreement unless similar rights are granted to Wanda.
 
(b)  Subsequent Registration Rights.  
The Company shall not grant to any Person registration rights unless the rights are consistent with the provisions of this Agreement.  
The Company shall not grant to any Person the right to request the Company to register any securities other than securities of the same class as the Registerable Securities being registered pursuant to a Demand Request.
 
(c)   Transfers by Holders.
The Wanda Holders may transfer their rights under this Agreement only in connection with a transfer of Class A Common Stock and only if the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by this Agreement in the same capacity as the transferor (and, for the sake of clarity, such transferee shall be entitled to all rights of such transferor) with respect to such transferred Class A Common Stock.  
This Section 
10(c) shall apply to all future permitted transfers of the Class A Common Stock.
 
Section 11.            Indemnification.
 
(a)  Indemnification by the Company.  
The Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Holder, its Affiliates and each Person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and their respective officers and directors against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or applicable “blue sky” laws, except insofar as the same (i) are made in reliance and in conformity with information relating to such Holder furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein or (ii) are caused by such Holder’s failure to deliver to such Holder’s immediate purchaser
a copy of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto (if the same was required by applicable law to be so delivered) after the Company has furnished such Holder with a sufficient number of copies of the same.  
In connection with an Underwritten Offering, the Company shall
 
15


 
indemnify such underwriters, each Person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and their respective officers and directors to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders.
 
(b)  Indemnification by the Holders.  
In connection with any Registration Statement in which there are Participating Holders, each such Participating Holder shall furnish to the Company in writing such information as the Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus and shall indemnify, severally and not jointly, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company, its Affiliates and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and their respective officers and directors against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that the same are made in reliance and in conformity with information relating to such Holder furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein or caused by such Holder’s failure to deliver to such Holder
’s immediate purchaser
a copy of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto
(if the same was required by applicable law to be so delivered) after the Company has furnished such Holder with a sufficient number of copies of the same; provided, however, that the liability of each such Holder shall be in proportion to and limited to the net amount received by such Holder from the sale of Registerable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.
The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified Person or any officer, director or controlling Person of such indemnified Person and shall survive the transfer of securities.
 
(c)   Indemnification Procedures.  
Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification and (ii) unless in such indemnified party’s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.  
If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (so long as such consent is not withheld unreasonably).  
An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party there may be one or more legal or equitable defenses available to such indemnified party that are in addition to or may conflict with those available to another indemnified party with respect to such claim.  
Failure to give prompt written notice shall not release the indemnifying party from its obligations hereunder except to the extent such party is materially prejudiced thereby.
 
16


 
(d)  Contribution.  
If the indemnification provided for, in, or pursuant to, this Section 11 is due in accordance with the terms hereof but is held by a court to be unavailable or unenforceable in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein (except, for purposes of clarity, any exclusions to indemnification expressly provided for in Section 11(a) or (b)), then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and of the indemnified party, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that result in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided that no Holder shall be required to contribute more than its pro rata share of any such contribution.  
The relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and of the indemnified party, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party, and by such party’s relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  
In no event shall the liability of any selling Holder be greater in amount than the amount of net proceeds received by such Holder upon such sale or the amount for which such indemnifying party would have been obligated to pay by way of indemnification if the indemnification provided for under Section 11(a) or 11(b) had been available under the circumstances.
 
Section 12.            Participation in Underwritten Offerings.  
No Person (including the Holders) may participate in any Underwritten Offering pursuant to a registration effected hereunder unless such Person (a) agrees to sell such Person’s Registerable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Holder(s) selecting the underwriter for such Underwritten Offering pursuant to this Agreement (by a majority of the class of Registerable Securities that is being registered by such initiating Holder), in the case of any Underwritten Offering pursuant to a Demand Request or Shelf Takedown, or by the Company, in any other case and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements, lock-ups and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements, provided, however, that no such lock-up may be more restrictive than or otherwise inconsistent with the lock-up permitted by Section 6 hereof.
 
Section 13.            
Securities Act Restrictions.  
The Registerable Securities are restricted securities under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an effective Registration Statement or an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act.  
Accordingly, the Holders shall not, directly or through others, offer or sell any Registerable Securities except pursuant to a Registration Statement as contemplated herein or pursuant to Rule 144 or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act, if available.  
Prior to any transfer of Registerable Securities other than pursuant to an effective Registration Statement, the Holder seeking to transfer Registerable Securities shall notify the Company of such transfer and the Company may require the Holder to provide, prior to such transfer, such evidence that the transfer will comply with the Securities Act (including written representations or an opinion of counsel) as the Company may reasonably request.  
The Company may impose stop-transfer
 
17


 
instructions with respect to any Registerable Securities that are to be transferred in contravention of this Agreement.  
Any certificates representing the Registerable Securities may bear a legend (and the Company’s share registry may bear a notation) referencing the restrictions on transfer contained in this Agreement, until such time as such securities have ceased to be, or are to be transferred in a manner that results in their ceasing to be, Registerable Securities.  
The legend will be in substantially the following form:
 
THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED
BY
THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR
UNDER ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS.
SUCH
SECURITIES MAY 
NOT BE SOLD, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED
AT
ANY TIME WITHOUT EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT AND LAWS OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM.
 
Subject to the provisions of this Section 13, the Company will replace any such legended certificates with unlegended certificates promptly upon request by any Holder in order to facilitate a lawful transfer or at any time after such shares cease to be Registerable Securities or are exempt from registration under the Securities Act.
 
Section 14.            Miscellaneous.
 
(a)  Notices.  
Except as otherwise provided herein, all notices, requests, consents and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be effective if hand-delivered, mailed (postage prepaid) by registered or certified mail or sent by e-mail (with e-mail or telephone confirmation promptly thereafter) or facsimile transmission (with automated or telephone confirmation promptly thereafter).
