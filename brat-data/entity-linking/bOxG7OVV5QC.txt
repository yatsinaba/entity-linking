ARTICLE II - GENERAL TERMS
 
Section 2.1            Loan Commitment; Disbursement to Borrower.
 
2.1.1       Agreement to Lend and Borrow.
Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, Lender hereby agrees to make and Borrower hereby agrees to accept the Loan on the Closing Date.
 
2.1.2       Single Disbursement to Borrower.
Borrower may request and receive only one (1) borrowing hereunder in respect of the Loan and any amount borrowed and repaid hereunder in respect of the Loan may not be reborrowed.
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Loan has been fully funded as of the Closing Date.
 
2.1.3        
The Note, Security Instrument and Loan Documents.
The Loan shall be evidenced by the Note and secured by the Security Instruments and the other Loan Documents.
 
2.1.4       
Use of Proceeds.
Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Loan to (a) acquire the Property or repay and discharge any existing loans relating to the Property, (b) pay all past due basic carrying costs, if any, with respect to the Property,
(c) make deposits into the Reserve Funds on the Closing Date in the amounts provided herein,
(d) pay costs and expenses incurred in connection with the closing of the Loan, as approved by Lender, (e) fund any working capital requirements of the Property and
(f) distribute the balance, if any, to Borrower.
 
Section 2.2            Interest Rate.
 
2.2.1       Interest Rate.
Interest on the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Loan shall accrue at the Interest Rate or as otherwise set forth in this Agreement or in the Note from (and including) the Closing Date to but excluding the Maturity Date.
 
2.2.2       
Interest Calculation.
Interest on the outstanding principal balance of the Loan shall be calculated by multiplying (a) the actual number of days elapsed in the relevant Accrual Period by (b) a daily rate based on the Interest Rate and a three hundred sixty (360) day year by (c) the outstanding principal balance of the Loan.
Borrower acknowledges that the calculation method for interest described herein results in a higher effective interest rate than the numeric Interest Rate and Borrower
hereby agrees to this calculation method.
 
2.2.3       Default Rate.
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (including the failure of Borrower to make full payment on the Maturity Date), Lender shall be entitled to receive and
Borrower shall pay interest on the Outstanding Principal Balance at the Default Rate.
Interest shall accrue and be payable at the Default Rate from the occurrence of an Event of Default until all Events of Default have been waived in writing by Lender in its discretion.
Such accrued interest shall be added to the Outstanding Principal Balance, and interest shall accrue thereon at the Default Rate until fully paid.
Such accrued interest shall be secured by the Security Instrument and other Loan Documents.
Borrower agrees that Lender’s right to collect interest at the Default Rate is given for the purpose of compensating Lender at reasonable amounts for Lender’s added costs and expenses that occur as a result of Borrower’s default and that are difficult to predict in amount, such as increased general overhead, concentration of management resources on problem loans, and increased cost of funds.
Lender and Borrower agree that Lender’s collection of interest at the Default Rate is not a fine or penalty, but is intended to be and shall be deemed to be reasonable compensation to Lender for increased costs and expenses that Lender will incur if there occurs an Event of Default hereunder.
Collection of interest at the Default Rate shall not be construed as an agreement or privilege to extend the Maturity Date or to limit or impair any rights and remedies of Lender under any Loan Documents.
If judgment is entered on the Note, interest shall continue to accrue post-judgment at the greater of (a) the Default Rate or (b) the applicable statutory judgment rate.
 
42
 
 
2.2.4       Usury Savings.
This Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents are subject to the express condition that at no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay interest on the principal balance of the Loan at a rate which could subject Lender to either civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate.
If, by the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Borrower is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on the principal balance due hereunder at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the Interest Rate or the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be immediately reduced to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and not on account of the interest due hereunder.
All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not exceed the Maximum Legal Rate of interest from time to time in effect and applicable to the Loan for so long as the Loan is outstanding.

Payments of principal, interest, and Late Charges (as defined in the Note) shall be made as provided in the Note.

2.6.1       Release of Property.
(a)
If Borrower has the right to and has elected to prepay in full the Loan in accordance with this Agreement and the Note, upon satisfaction of the requirements of Section 2.4 and Section 9 of the Note, as applicable, and this Section 2.6, each applicable Individual Property shall be released from the Lien of the applicable Security Instrument.
 
43
 
 
(b)           In connection with the release of each applicable Security Instrument, Borrower shall submit to Lender, not less than fifteen (
15) days prior to the Prepayment Date, a release of Lien (and related Loan Documents) for each Individual Property for execution by Lender.
Each such release shall be in a form appropriate in the jurisdiction in which the applicable Individual Property is located and that would be satisfactory to a prudent lender and contains standard provisions, if any, protecting the rights of the releasing lender.
In addition, Borrower shall provide all other documentation Lender reasonably requires to be delivered by Borrower in connection with such release, together with an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such documentation (i) is in compliance with all Legal Requirements, and (ii) will effect such releases in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(c)           
If, in connection with a payment in full of the Loan, Borrower advises Lender that it desires Lender to assign the Loan Documents to a Person designated by Borrower (the “Full Assignee Lender”), then Lender shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with Borrower to assign and deliver originals of the Loan Documents to the Full Assignee Lender or as directed by Borrower, including (i) an allonge with respect to the Note, (ii)
executed assignments of the recorded Loan Documents, and (iii)
such other instruments of conveyance, assignment, termination, severance and release (including appropriate UCC-3 termination statements and terminations of rent direction notices to Tenants and other third parties), all in recordable form as may reasonably be requested by Borrower to evidence such assignment; provided, however, that such assignment shall be made without representation, warranty or covenant by Lender (other than that Lender is the lawful owner of the Loan Documents, and Lender has the power to assign the same and the outstanding principal balance thereof).
 
2.6.2       Partial Release.
Provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrower shall have the right at any time after November 1, 2021, and prior to the Maturity Date to obtain the release (the “Partial Release”) of any one or more of the Individual Properties (individually and collectively, as the context requires, the “Released Property”) from the lien of the applicable Security Instrument thereon (and related Loan Documents) and the release of Borrower’s obligations under the Loan Documents with respect to such Released Property (other than those expressly stated to survive), upon the satisfaction of each of the following conditions precedent:

In addition, Borrower shall provide all other documentation as may reasonably be required to satisfy the Prudent Lender Standard in connection with such release, together with an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such documentation (i) is in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements, and (ii) will effect such release in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;
 
(e)            
The future uses of the Released Property may not violate any exclusivity or other provision in any Lease pertaining to any Individual Property not being released nor any covenant, restriction, condition or other title matter then encumbering the Property;
 
(f)             Intentionally omitted;
 
(g)           If required under the operative documents with respect to any Securitization, Lender shall have received evidence in writing from any applicable Rating Agency to the effect that the proposed Partial Release will not result in a qualification, reduction, downgrade or withdrawal of any rating initially assigned or to be assigned in such Securitization, or a waiver from any such rating agency stating that it has declined to review the Partial Release;
 
(h)           
The Partial Release shall be permitted under REMIC Requirements in effect as of the consummation of the Partial Release, and, if reasonably required by the Rating Agencies to confirm the same, Borrower shall (i) deliver to Lender opinions of counsel satisfying the Prudent Lender Standard and acceptable the Rating Agencies (issued by counsel satisfying the Prudent Lender Standard and acceptable to the Rating Agencies)
(1) stating that the Partial Release will not cause (A) the Loan to cease to be a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Section 860G of the Code, either under the provisions of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.860G-2(a)(8) or 1.860G-2(b)
(as such regulations may be amended or superseded from time to time) or under any other provision of the Code or otherwise, and (B)
the failure of any REMIC Trust or any other entity that holds the Note to maintain its tax status and (2) with respect to such other matters as may be reasonably required by Lender and (ii) pay all of Lender’s reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses and the costs and expenses of the Rating Agencies in connection with the Partial Release, including, without limitation, reasonable out-of-pocket costs counsel fees;
 
45
 
 
(i)             
As of the date of consummation of the Partial Release, after giving effect to the release of the lien of the Security Instrument(s) encumbering the Released Property, the Debt Service Coverage Ratio with respect to the remaining Individual Properties (based upon the trailing twelve (12) month period) shall be equal to or greater than the greater of (i) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio as of the Closing Date and (ii)
the Debt Service Coverage Ratio immediately prior to the consummation of the Partial Release;
 
(j)             
As of the date of consummation of the Partial Release, after giving effect to the release of the lien of the Security Instrument(s) encumbering the Released Property, the Debt Yield with respect to the remaining Individual Properties (based upon the trailing twelve (12) month period) shall be no less than the greater of (i) the Debt Yield as of the Closing Date or (ii)
the Debt Yield immediately prior to the consummation of the Partial Release;
 
(k)            Borrower shall
(i) partially prepay the Debt in accordance with Section 9 of the Note in an amount equal to 115% (120% if the Released Property is being transferred to a Borrower Affiliate) of the Allocated Loan Amount for the Released Property (the “Release Amount”), (ii) unless such prepayment is tendered on a Payment Date, pay to Lender an amount equal to the interest that would have accrued on the amount being prepaid for the full Accrual Period
had the prepayment not been made and
(iii) pay to Lender the Prepayment Consideration (as defined in the Note) to the extent that such prepayment occurs at any time other than on or after the Permitted Par Prepayment Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Release Amount shall be an amount equal to 105% of the Allocated Loan Amount for the Released Property if, with respect to the Released Property, as of each of the Partial Release Notice Date and the date of consummation of the Partial Release, (i)
the sole Tenant at such Released Property is the subject of a Bankruptcy Action, (ii)
the sole Tenant at such Released Property has ceased business operations or otherwise “gone dark” at all or substantially all of its demised premises at the Released Property or has given written notice to Borrower that it intends to cease to conduct its business operations or otherwise “go dark” at all or substantially all of its demised premises at the Released Property, (iii)
a default (beyond any applicable notice and cure period) by the sole Tenant at such Released Property is then continuing under its applicable Lease or (iv)
a DSCR Trigger Event has occurred and Lender determines that the Debt Service Coverage Ratio, based on the trailing three

Any portion of the Release Amount applied to the principal amount of the Debt shall be applied first, to reduce the Allocated Loan Amount attributable to the Released Property to zero and second, pro rata to reduce the Allocated Loan Amounts of each of the other remaining Individual Properties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Lender has applied the Net Proceeds from a Casualty or Condemnation of an Individual Property to the repayment of the Debt and a Partial Release of such Individual Property is thereafter completed, (1) the Release Amount for such Individual Property shall be reduced by the amount of such Net Proceeds so applied, and (2) no Prepayment Consideration or similar sum shall be due in connection therewith; and
 
46
 
 
(l)             
If, in connection with a Partial Release, Borrower advises Lender that it desires Lender to assign the applicable Security Instrument and other Loan Documents (collectively, the “Assigned Loan Documents”) encumbering the Released Properties that are the subject of a Partial Release (collectively, the “Assigned Properties”) to a Person designated by Borrower (the “Partial Assignee Lender”), then Lender shall (a) cooperate in all reasonable respects with Borrower (i) to split and sever each Promissory Note constituting the Note into two Notes, with one such Note (each, a “Remaining Note”) continuing to evidence the portion of the Loan secured by the Individual Properties that are not Assigned Properties (collectively, the “Remaining Properties”), and the other such Note (each, an “Assigned Note”)
securing the portion of the Loan to be secured by the Assigned Properties, and (ii) to assign the Assigned Note and the Assigned Loan Documents to the Partial Assignee Lender, with assignments of the recorded Assigned Loan Documents in recordable form and otherwise in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Lender and the Partial Assignee Lender, (b) deliver to the Partial Assignee Lender or as directed by Borrower the originally executed Assigned Note,
(c) execute and deliver to the Partial Assignee Lender or as directed by Borrower, (i)
an allonge with respect to the Assigned Note, (ii) executed  assignments of the recorded Assigned Loan Documents (and the original applicable Assigned Loan Documents or a certified copy of record to the assignee thereof), and (iii)
such other instruments of conveyance, assignment, termination, severance and release (including appropriate UCC-3 termination statements and terminations of rent direction notices to Tenants and other third parties), all in recordable form as may reasonably be requested by Borrower to evidence such assignment; provided, however, that such assignment shall be made without representation, warranty or covenant by Lender (other than that Lender is the lawful owner of such Assigned Note and the Assigned Loan Documents, and Lender has the power to assign the same and the outstanding principal balance thereof).
In connection with any assignment effected in accordance with this paragraph, Borrower shall deliver the following: (I) New York enforceability and entity authority opinion letters, reasonably required by Lender, (II) organizational documents of Borrower, Guarantor and any entities executing documents on behalf of Borrower or Guarantor, as reasonably required by Lender, and (III) such other documents and agreements as may be reasonable required by Lender.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.6.2, the parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that after the Securitization of the Loan (or any portion thereof or interest therein), with respect to any Lender approval or similar discretionary rights over any matters contained in this Section 2.6.2, such rights shall be construed such that Lender shall only be permitted to withhold its consent or approval with respect to any such matters if the same fails to meet the Prudent Lender Standard.
 
2.6.3       
Partial Release of Unimproved Land.
In the event that Borrower shall receive from the Tenant under the Quest Lease (“Quest”) an “Expansion Notice” (as defined in the Quest Lease) pursuant to Article 27 of the Quest Lease requesting that Borrower construct a new building on Parcel 1 or Parcel 2
(each as defined in the Quest Lease) or any combination of Parcel 1 and Parcel 2 (the “Outparcel Expansion”), then Borrower shall, within five (5) Business Days of its receipt of such Expansion Notice, provide written notice to Lender of its receipt of such Expansion Notice, together with a copy of such Expansion Notice and all other information delivered by Quest to Borrower with the Expansion Notice related to such Expansion Notice.
Within sixty (60) days of its receipt of such Expansion Notice or as soon thereafter as may be reasonably practical in the exercise of due diligence (and in all events prior to either
(i) the commencement of any construction in connection with any Expansion (as defined in the Quest Lease) or (ii) the execution by Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower of any written agreement for the construction of all or any portion of the Outparcel Expansion), Borrower shall (and Lender shall permit Borrower to) take such actions as may be reasonably necessary to cause Parcel 1 and/or Parcel 2, as applicable (the “Released Land”) to be released from the lien of the Security Instrument and all other Loan Documents (the “Quest Partial Release”), which actions shall include, without limitation, the following:
 
47
 
 
(a)           Borrower shall provide evidence and documentation reasonably satisfactory to Lender (which shall include, without limitation, a zoning report, title endorsements (in accordance with clause (e) below) and a survey of the Released Land and the Remaining Land)
(i)
that the Released Land has been separately subdivided or otherwise lawfully “split” from that part of the Quest Property which shall remain encumbered by the lien of the Security Instrument (“Remaining Land”) and that the Released Land and Remaining Land will be each assessed as a separate tax parcel with respect to all property taxes and assessments, (ii) of the grant of a security interest for the benefit of Lender in any easements for the benefit of the Remaining Land created as a part of the Quest Partial Release,
(iii) that following the Quest Partial Release, the Remaining Land will comply with all state and local land use and zoning laws (including minimum lot size, minimum parking requirements, setback requirements, lot coverage ratios, frontage, subdivision, site plan approval and access to a public rights of way),
(iv) that following the Quest Partial Release, the Remaining Land has access to a dedicated and physically open street and water, gas, electric, telephone, storm sewer and sanitary sewer services either over, under or upon public rights of way directly adjacent to the Remaining Land or over, under or upon an easement (not terminable by the grantor thereof or by such grantor’s heirs, personal representatives, successor or assigns) for the benefit of said Remaining Land that connects to public rights of way, (v) that all required notices have been given and consents obtained in connection with the proposed Quest Partial Release, including the consent of any Guarantor, and (vi)
that expenses for the operation and maintenance of the Released Land and the Remaining Land are segregated from each other or any costs associated with common elements between Released Land and the Remaining are allocated between Borrower and the owner of the Released Land pursuant to a written agreement that is reasonably acceptable to Lender.
 
(b)          Upon Lender’s or Borrower’s request, if the same is required for the Remaining Land to be managed and operated in the same manner as prior to the release of the Released Land or, if the same is required or desirable for the construction or operation of the Released Land, Borrower shall cause to be recorded a reciprocal easement agreement or declaration of reciprocal easements providing reciprocal rights of parking, ingress, egress and other matters as may be required by Lender or Borrower, between and across the Released Land and the Remaining Land, such reciprocal easement agreement or declaration to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender and, in connection with which, Lender agrees to subordinate its lien securing the Loan;
 
(c)           Borrower and Quest shall enter into an amendment of the Quest Lease reasonably acceptable to Lender, which amendment shall, among other things, modify the description of the premises demised thereunder to include only the Remaining Land and the improvements thereon and remove any further rights of expansion of such Tenant (or otherwise confirming that Quest has no further rights of expansion) with respect to the Remaining Land and a separate lease shall be entered into between Quest or its affiliate and the transferee of the Released Land with respect to the Released Land;
 
48
 
 
(d)          Borrower shall submit to Lender, not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of such Quest Partial Release, a release of lien (and related Loan Documents) for the Released Land for execution by Lender.
Such release shall be in a form appropriate in the jurisdiction in which the Released Land is located and shall contain standard provisions, if any, protecting the rights of Lender; and
 
(e)          Borrower shall deliver an endorsement to Lender’s title policy at Borrower’s expense (not to exceed an amount equal to $1,500) insuring the priority of the Security Instrument as a first lien (subject to Permitted Encumbrances) on the Remaining Land (to be properly legally described) in accordance with all the provisions of the title policy (and updating the title policy with no additional title matters), together with an updated title search indicating that the Remaining Land is free from all liens, claims and other encumbrances not previously approved by Lender other than Permitted Encumbrances.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.6.3, if the Loan or any portion thereof is included in a REMIC Trust and, immediately following a release pursuant to this Section 2.6.3, the Loan to Value Ratio (such value to be determined, in Lender’s reasonable discretion, by any commercially reasonable method permitted to a REMIC Trust and which shall exclude the personal property or going concern value, if any) is greater than 125%, Lender may, in its sole discretion, require that either (i)
the principal balance of the Loan must be paid down by a “qualified amount” as that term is defined in IRS Revenue Procedure 2010-30 or
(ii) Borrower shall deliver to Lender opinions of counsel satisfying the Prudent Lender Standard and acceptable the Rating Agencies (issued by counsel satisfying the Prudent Lender Standard and acceptable to the Rating Agencies) stating that the Quest Partial Release will not cause (A) the Loan to cease to be a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Section 860G of the Code, either under the provisions of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.860G-2(a)(8) or 1.860G-2(b)
(as such regulations may be amended or superseded from time to time) or under any other provision of the Code or otherwise, and (B)
the failure of any REMIC Trust or any other entity that holds the Note to maintain its tax status.
Except as may be required pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Borrower shall not be required to make any prepayment of the Loan in connection with the Quest Partial Release; provided, however, that Borrower agrees to pay or reimburse Lender for all out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by Lender in connection with the Quest Partial Release (including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees, title insurance costs and recording costs).
 
Borrower covenants that it shall not commence construction on or with respect to the Outparcel Expansion or enter into any covenant related thereto which is not cancelable without penalty prior to the consummation of the Quest Partial Release in accordance with this Section 2.6.3 and any such actions taken by Borrower shall constitute an immediate Event of Default without any further notice from Lender.
 
Section 2.7           Clearing Account/Cash Management.
 
2.7.1       Clearing Account.
(a)
During the term of the Loan, Borrower shall establish and maintain an Eligible Account (the “Clearing Account”) with Clearing Bank for the benefit of Lender, which Clearing Account shall be under the sole dominion and control of Lender.
The Clearing Account shall be entitled in the name of Borrower for the benefit of Lender.
Borrower hereby grants to Lender a first-priority security interest in the Clearing Account and all deposits at any time contained therein and the proceeds thereof and shall take all actions necessary to maintain in favor of Lender a perfected first priority security interest in the Clearing Account, including filing UCC-1 Financing Statements and continuations thereof.
Lender and Servicer shall have the sole right to make withdrawals from the Clearing Account.
All costs and expenses for establishing and maintaining the Clearing Account shall be paid by Borrower.
All monies on deposit in the Clearing Account shall be deemed additional security for the Debt.
The Clearing Account Agreement and Clearing Account shall remain in effect until the Loan has been repaid in full.

(c)            Borrower shall obtain from Clearing Bank
its agreement to transfer on each Business Day all amounts on deposit in the Clearing Account at the direction of Borrower unless a Cash Sweep Period is in effect, in which case such funds shall be transferred to the Cash Management Account.

(g)           Borrower shall indemnify Lender and hold Lender harmless from and against any and all actions, suits, claims, and demands, and actual out-of-pocket liabilities, losses, damages (
excluding, in all events, consequential, punitive, special, exemplary and indirect damages), obligations and costs and expenses (including litigation costs and reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees and expenses) arising from or in any way connected with the Clearing Account or the Clearing Account Agreement (unless arising from the gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of Lender) or the performance of the obligations for which the Clearing Account was established.
 
50
 
 
(h)           
Upon (i) Clearing Bank ceasing to be an Eligible Institution, (ii) the Clearing Account ceasing to be an Eligible Account, (iii) any resignation by Clearing Bank or termination of the Clearing Account Agreement by Clearing Bank or Lender or (iv) the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, Borrower shall, within fifteen (15) days of Lender’s written request,
(A) terminate the existing Clearing Account Agreement,
(B) appoint a new Clearing Bank (which such Clearing Bank shall (I) be an Eligible Institution, (II) other than during the continuance of an Event of Default, be selected by Borrower and reasonably approved by Lender and (III) during the continuance of an Event of Default, be selected by Lender),

Borrower constitutes and appoints Lender its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution to complete or undertake any action required of Borrower under this Section 2.7.1 in the name of Borrower in the event
Borrower fails to do the same.
Such power of attorney shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked.
 
2.7.2       Cash Management Account.
(a) Upon the occurrence of a Cash Sweep Event, a segregated Eligible Account (the “Cash Management Account”) shall be established and maintained with Agent in Borrower’s name for the benefit of Lender, which Cash Management Account shall be under the sole dominion and control of Lender.
Borrower hereby grants to Lender a first priority security interest in the Cash Management Account and all deposits at any time contained therein and the proceeds thereof and shall take all actions necessary to maintain in favor of Lender a perfected first priority security interest in the Cash Management Account, including filing UCC-1 Financing Statements and continuations thereof.
Lender and Servicer shall have the sole right to make withdrawals from the Cash Management Account and all reasonable costs and expenses for establishing and maintaining the Cash Management Account shall be paid by Borrower.
 
(b)           The insufficiency of funds on deposit in the Cash Management Account shall not relieve Borrower from the obligation to make any payments, as and when due pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and such obligations shall be separate and independent, and not conditioned on any event or circumstance whatsoever.
 
(c)           All funds on deposit in the Cash Management Account during the continuance of an Event of Default or any Bankruptcy Action of Borrower may be applied by Lender in such order and priority as Lender shall determine.

There are no actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity, arbitrations, or governmental investigations by or before any Governmental Authority or other agency now pending, filed, or, to Borrower’s knowledge, threatened in writing against or affecting Borrower, Guarantor or the Property or any portion thereof, which would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect (a) title to the Property or any portion thereof;

Borrower is not a party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any restriction which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect Borrower or the Property (or any portion thereof), or Borrower’s business, properties or assets, operations or condition, financial or otherwise.
Borrower is not in default in any material respect in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which Borrower or the Property (or any portion thereof) is bound.
Borrower has no material financial obligation under any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which Borrower is a party or by which Borrower or the Property (or any portion thereof) is otherwise bound, other than (a) obligations incurred in the ordinary course of the operation of the Property as permitted pursuant to clause (xxiii) of the definition of “Special Purpose Entity” set forth in Section 1.1 hereof and
(b) obligations under the Loan Documents.
 
4.1.6

The Permitted Encumbrances in the aggregate do not materially and adversely affect the value, operation or use of the Property (or any portion thereof) as currently used or Borrower’s ability to repay the Loan.
Each Security Instrument, when properly recorded in the appropriate records, together with any Uniform Commercial Code financing statements required to be filed in connection therewith, will create (a) a valid, perfected first priority lien on the applicable Individual Property, subject only to Permitted Encumbrances and the Liens created by the Loan Documents and
(b) perfected security interests in and to, and perfected collateral assignments of, all personalty (including the Leases), all in accordance with the terms thereof, in each case subject only to any applicable Permitted Encumbrances, such other Liens

Solvency.
Borrower has (a) not entered into this transaction or executed the Note, this Agreement or any other Loan Documents with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any creditor and (b) received reasonably equivalent value in exchange for its obligations under such Loan Documents.
Giving effect to the Loan, the fair saleable value of Borrower’s assets exceeds and will, immediately following the making of the Loan, exceed Borrower’s total liabilities, including subordinated, unliquidated, disputed and contingent liabilities.
The fair saleable value of Borrower’s assets is and will, immediately following the making of the Loan, be greater than Borrower’s probable liabilities, including the maximum amount of its contingent liabilities on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured.
Borrower’s assets do not and, immediately following the making of the Loan will not, constitute unreasonably small capital to carry out its business as conducted or as proposed to be conducted.
Borrower does not intend to, and does not believe that it will, incur debt and liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments) beyond its ability to pay such debt and liabilities as they mature (taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be received by Borrower and the amounts to be payable on or in respect of obligations of Borrower).
No petition in bankruptcy has been filed against Borrower or any Person Controlling Borrower in the last seven (7) years, and neither Borrower nor any Person Controlling Borrower in the last seven (7) years has ever made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or taken advantage of any insolvency act for the benefit of debtors.
Neither Borrower nor any of its Persons
Controlling Borrower are contemplating either the filing of a petition by it under any state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency laws or the liquidation of all or a major portion of Borrower’s assets or property, and Borrower has no knowledge of any Person contemplating the filing of any such petition against it or such constituent Persons.
 
53
 
 
4.1.8       
Full and Accurate Disclosure.
No statement of fact made by Borrower in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make statements contained herein or therein not misleading.
There is no material fact presently known to Borrower which has not been disclosed to Lender which adversely affects, nor as far as Borrower can foresee, would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, the Property or the business, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of Borrower (provided that the foregoing is meant to relate specifically to Borrower and the Property and not, by way of example only, to the economy of the United States or the location of the Property).
 
4.1.9       
No Plan Assets.
Borrower does not sponsor, is not obligated to contribute to, and is not itself an “employee benefit plan,” as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and none of the assets of Borrower constitutes or will constitute “plan assets” of one or more such plans within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA.
In addition, (a) Borrower is not a “governmental plan” within the meaning of Section 3(32) of ERISA and
(b) assuming the counter party is not a governmental plan,
transactions by or with Borrower are not subject to any state or other statute, regulation or other restriction regulating investments of, or fiduciary obligations with respect to, governmental plans within the meaning of Section 3(32) of ERISA which is similar to the provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code which, as of the date hereof, prohibit or otherwise restrict the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the exercise by Lender of any of its rights under the Loan Documents.
 
4.1.10     Compliance.

whichever first occurs, and notwithstanding that the policy may expire prior to the end of such period.

88
 
 
(c)           
Any blanket insurance Policy shall provide the same protection as would a separate Policy insuring only the applicable Individual Property in compliance with the provisions of Section 6.1(a)
hereof.
Lender may determine (including at the request of Borrower), in its reasonable discretion, the amount of such coverage that is sufficient in light of the other risks and properties insured under the blanket policy based on a review of the relevant schedule of locations limited to the minimum details required and based on zip code, county or radial distance, including property values.

(e)           All Policies shall contain clauses or endorsements to the effect that:
 
(i)             
no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone acting for Borrower, or of any Tenant or other occupant, or failure to comply with the provisions of any Policy, which might otherwise result in a forfeiture of the insurance or any part thereof, shall in any way affect the validity or enforceability of the insurance insofar as Lender is concerned;
 
(ii)            the Policy shall not be canceled (A) for nonpayment of a premium without at least ten (10) days written notice to Lender and any other party named therein as an additional insured, and (B) for any reason other than nonpayment of a premium without at least thirty (30) days written notice to Lender and any other party named therein as an additional insured;
 
(iii)           intentionally omitted; and
 
(iv)           Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance Premiums thereon or subject to any assessments thereunder.
 
(f)            
If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written evidence that all insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Lender shall have the right to take such action as Lender deems reasonably necessary to protect its interest in the applicable Individual Property, including the obtaining of such insurance coverage as Lender in its reasonable discretion deems appropriate after three (3) Business Days’ notice to Borrower if prior to the date upon which any such coverage will lapse or at any time Lender reasonably deems necessary (regardless of prior notice to Borrower) to avoid the lapse of any such coverage.
All premiums incurred by Lender in connection with such action or in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by Borrower to Lender upon demand and, until paid, shall be secured by the Security Instrument and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

Borrower shall pay or cause to be paid all costs of such Restoration whether or not such costs are covered by insurance.
Lender may, but shall not be obligated to make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower.
In addition, Lender may participate in any settlement discussions with any insurance companies (and shall approve the final settlement, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) with respect to any Casualty in which the Net Proceeds or the costs of completing the Restoration are equal to or greater than the Availability Threshold and Borrower shall deliver to Lender all instruments reasonably required by Lender to permit such participation.
 
Section 6.3           Condemnation.
Borrower shall promptly give Lender notice of the commencement of any proceeding for the Condemnation of any Individual Property (or any portion thereof) and shall deliver to Lender copies of any and all papers served in connection with such proceedings.

Borrower shall, at its expense, diligently prosecute any such proceedings, and shall consult with Lender, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in the carrying on or defense of any such proceedings.
Notwithstanding any taking by any public or quasi-public authority through Condemnation or otherwise (including any transfer made in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of such taking), Borrower shall continue to pay the Debt at the time and in the manner provided for its payment in the Note and in this Agreement and the Debt shall not be reduced until any Award shall have been actually received and applied by Lender, after the deduction of expenses of collection, to the reduction or discharge of the Debt.
Lender shall not be limited to the interest paid on the Award by the condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive out of the Award interest at the rate or rates
provided herein or in the Note.
If any portion of any Individual Property is taken by a condemning authority, Borrower shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute the Restoration of the Property pursuant to Section 6.4 hereof and otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 6.4 hereof.
If the applicable Individual Property is sold, through foreclosure or otherwise, prior to the receipt by Lender of the Award, Lender shall have the right, whether or not a deficiency judgment on the Note shall have been sought, recovered or denied, to receive the Award, or a portion thereof sufficient to pay the Debt.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.3, and Section 6.4 hereof, if the Loan or any portion thereof is included in a REMIC Trust and, immediately following a release of any portion of the Lien of the Security Instrument in connection with a Condemnation (but taking into account any proposed Restoration on the remaining portion of the Property), the Loan to Value Ratio is greater than 125% (such value to be determined, in Lender’s sole discretion, by any commercially reasonable method permitted to a REMIC Trust and, if the Property is a hospitality property, determination of such value shall exclude personal property and going concern value, if any), the principal balance of the Loan must be paid down (without payment of Prepayment Consideration) in an amount sufficient to satisfy the REMIC Requirements, unless the Lender receives an opinion of counsel that if such amount is not paid, the Securitization will not fail to maintain its status as a REMIC Trust and that the REMIC Trust will not be subject to tax as a result of the related release of such portion of the Lien of the Security Instrument.
In connection with the foregoing, the Net Proceeds shall not be available for Restoration and shall be used to pay down the principal balance of the Loan to the extent set forth above.

In no event shall Lender be obligated to make disbursements of the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the costs actually incurred from time to time for work in place as part of the Restoration, as certified by the Casualty Consultant, minus the Casualty Retainage.
The term “Casualty Retainage” means an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the costs actually incurred for work in place as part of the Restoration, as certified by the Casualty Consultant until the Restoration is fifty percent (50%) complete and five percent (5%)
thereafter until the Restoration has been completed.
The Casualty Retainage shall in no event, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above in this Section 6.4(b), be less than the amount actually held back by Borrower from contractors, subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration.
The Casualty Retainage shall not be released until the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.4(b) and that all approvals necessary for the re-occupancy and use of the Property have been obtained from all appropriate governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, and Lender receives evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that the costs of the Restoration have been paid in full or will be paid in full out of the Casualty Retainage; provided, however, that Lender shall release the portion of the Casualty Retainage being held with respect to any contractor, subcontractor or materialman engaged in the Restoration as of the date upon which the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the contractor, subcontractor or materialman has completed all work and has supplied all materials in accordance with the provisions of the contractor
’s, subcontractor’s or materialman’s contract, the contractor, subcontractor or materialman delivers the lien waivers and evidence of payment in full of all sums due to the contractor, subcontractor or materialman as may be reasonably requested by Lender or by the title company issuing the Title Insurance Policy, and Lender receives evidence reasonably acceptable to Lender evidencing that the applicable Title Insurance Policy continues to insure the priority of the lien of the applicable Security Instrument over any mechanic’s or materialmen
’s lien related to the Restoration.
If required by Lender, the release of any such portion of the Casualty Retainage shall be approved by the surety company, if any, which has issued a payment or performance bond with respect to the contractor, subcontractor or materialman.
 
(v)           Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements of the Net Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month.
 
(vi)          
If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed balance thereof shall not, in the reasonable opinion of Lender in consultation with the Casualty Consultant, be sufficient to pay in full the balance of the costs which are estimated by the Casualty Consultant to be incurred in connection with the completion of the Restoration, Borrower shall deposit the deficiency (the “Net Proceeds Deficiency”) with Lender before any further disbursement of the Net Proceeds shall be made.
The Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender shall be held by Lender and shall be disbursed for costs actually incurred in connection with the Restoration on the same conditions applicable to the disbursement of the Net Proceeds, and until so disbursed pursuant to this Section 6.4(b) shall constitute additional security for the Debt and Other Obligations under the Loan Documents.
 
(vii)         
Provided no continuing Event of Default shall then exist, after the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.4(b), and the receipt by Lender of evidence satisfactory to Lender in its reasonable discretion that all costs incurred in connection with the Restoration have been paid in full, the excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds (and the remaining balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency) deposited with Lender shall be (1) if a Cash Sweep Period then exists, deposited in the Cash Management Account to be disbursed in accordance with this Agreement, and (2) if no Cash Sweep Period then exists, disbursed to Borrower.
 
94
 
 
(c)           
All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for the Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds pursuant to Section 6.4(b)(vii)
hereof may be retained and applied by Lender toward the payment of the Debt in accordance with Section 9(b) of the Note, whether or not then due and payable in such order, priority and proportions as Lender in its reasonable discretion shall deem proper, or, at the discretion of Lender, the same may be paid, either in whole or in part, to Borrower for such purposes as Lender shall approve, in its reasonable discretion.
 
(d)           
In the event of foreclosure of the Security Instrument, or other transfer of title to the Property (or any portion thereof) in extinguishment in whole or in part of the Debt all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to the Policies that are not blanket Policies then in force concerning the Property and all proceeds payable thereunder shall thereupon vest in the purchaser at such foreclosure or Lender or other transferee in the event of such other transfer of title.
 
(e)           
Notwithstanding anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document, if Lender applies any Net Proceeds to the repayment of the Debt and such Net Proceeds are not sufficient to obtain the release of the Individual Property subject to the Casualty or Condemnation, Borrower may, in its sole discretion, repay a portion of the Loan in an amount equal to the difference between the applicable Release Amount and the Net Proceeds applied to repay the Loan, and satisfy all of the other conditions for Partial Release contained in Section 2.6.2 of this Agreement
, Lender shall release the lien of the Security Instrument from the applicable Individual Property, and no Prepayment Consideration or similar sum shall be due in connection therewith.
 
(f)            Intentionally Omitted.
 
(g)           
Notwithstanding anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document, if the applicable Legal Requirements (including the opportunity to seek a variance or special use permit) do not permit the Restoration of the Property to its condition that existed prior to the applicable Casualty or Condemnation due to any legally nonconforming conditions at the Property, Lender shall make the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration of the Property in accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements so long as Borrower provides reasonable evidence that following such Restoration, the requirements contained either in (i) Section 6.4(b)(i)(C)(1) and Section 6.4(b)(i)(C)(2), or in (ii) Section 6.4(b)(i)(C)(3) above shall be satisfied.
In the event that Borrower does not provide such reasonable evidence, all Net Proceeds shall be retained and applied by Lender toward the payment of the Debt in accordance with Section 9(b) of the Note (no Prepayment Consideration or similar sum shall be due in connection therewith), and Borrower shall complete a Partial Release of such affected Individual Property in accordance with Section 2.6.2 of this Agreement, provided, however, that the amount of any such applied the Net Proceeds shall be deducted from the applicable Release Amount for such Partial Release and further that no Prepayment Consideration or similar sum shall be due in connection therewith.

(ii) one-twelfth (1/12) of the Insurance Premiums that Lender estimates will be payable for the renewal of the coverage afforded by the Policies upon the expiration thereof in order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all such Insurance Premiums at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Policies (said amounts in (a) and (b) above hereinafter called the “Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund”).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as Borrower maintains blanket policies of insurance in accordance with Section 6.1 hereof, the provisions of this Section 7.2 with regard to Insurance Premiums shall not be applicable, until and unless Lender elects to apply such provisions following (i) the issuance by any insurer or its agent of any notice of cancellation, termination, or lapse of any insurance coverage required under Section 6.1 hereof, (ii) any cancellation, termination, or lapse of any insurance coverage required under Section 6.1 hereof whether or not any notice is issued, (iii) Lender having not received from Borrower evidence of insurance coverages as required by and in accordance with the terms of Section 6.1 hereof, or (iv) the occurrence of any Event of Default.
Lender shall apply the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund to payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums required to be made by Borrower pursuant to Section 5.1.2 hereof and under the Security Instrument.
In making any payment relating to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund, Lender may do so according to any bill, statement or estimate procured from the appropriate public office (with respect to Taxes) or insurer or agent (with respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax, assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof.

If at any time Lender reasonably determines that the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund is not or will not be sufficient to pay Taxes, Other Charges
and, if Borrower is required to deposit sums in the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund with respect to Insurance Premiums, Insurance Premiums by the dates set forth in (a) and (b) above, Lender shall notify Borrower in writing of such determination and Borrower shall increase its monthly payments to Lender by the amount that Lender reasonably estimates is sufficient to make up the deficiency
at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of the Taxes and Other Charges or, if applicable, thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the Policies, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a completed Partial Release, upon Borrower’s written request, Lender shall recalculate the monthly deposit required pursuant to (b) above taking into account the Individual Properties securing the Loan following such completed Partial Release and the Taxes and Other Charges that Lender reasonably estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months with respect to such Individual Properties.

Section 7.4            Rollover Reserve.

Borrower shall pay to Lender on each Payment Date during the existence of a Cash Sweep Period, an amount equal to $1.00 multiplied by the then existing aggregate net leasable area of the Property, divided by 12 (the “Rollover Reserve Monthly Deposit”), which amounts shall be deposited with and held by Lender for tenant improvement and leasing commission obligations incurred following the date hereof in connection with Leases entered into in accordance with the terms hereof (the “TILC Obligations”).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Rollover Reserve Monthly Deposit on each Payment Date after the occurrence of a Lease Rollover Trigger Event until the completion of the applicable Lease Rollover Cure Event shall be all Excess Cash Flow.
In the event of a Partial Release, the Rollover Reserve Monthly Deposit shall be reduced to be an amount equal to $1.00 multiplied by the total number of square feet of the Improvements located at the Individual Properties that are subject to the Loan following the completion of such Partial Release, divided by twelve.
Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Rollover Reserve Fund” and the account to which such amounts are held shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Rollover Reserve Account.”
Borrower shall also pay to Lender, for deposit into the Rollover Reserve Account, all fees and other payments made to Borrower in connection with or relating to the rejection, buy-out, termination, surrender or cancellation of any Lease (collectively, “Lease Termination Payments”); excepting, however, any Lease Termination Payments related to a Major Tenant Lease.
Notwithstanding the aforementioned, deposits to the Rollover Reserve Fund shall not cause the aggregate amount of the Rollover Reserve Fund to exceed $6,000,000.00 in the aggregate (the “Rollover Reserve Cap”) on any Payment Date
(after giving effect to the payment of the Rollover Reserve Monthly Deposit and any Lease Termination Payments) and accordingly, to the extent a Rollover Reserve Monthly Deposit or a deposit of a Lease Termination Payment would result in the aggregate amount of Rollover Reserve Funds in the Rollover Reserve Account exceeding the Rollover Reserve Cap, such Rollover Reserve Monthly Deposit or Lease Termination Payment deposit shall be decreased by an amount equal to such excess.
Any interest earned on funds on deposit in the Rollover Reserve Account shall be added to and become a part of the Rollover Reserve Fund.
In lieu of making the Rollover Reserve Monthly Deposits as required hereunder, Borrower shall be allowed to deposit with Lender an unconditional irrevocable letter of credit (the “Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit”)
in an amount initially equal to (a) if such Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit is deposited with Lender prior to the third Payment Date occurring during the existence of a Cash Sweep Period, $1.00 multiplied by the then existing aggregate net leasable area of the Property, divided by 4, and (b) if such Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit is deposited with Lender after the third Payment Date occurring during the existence of a Cash Sweep Period, the aggregate amount of all Rollover Reserve Funds then held by Lender (which Rollover Reserve Funds will be disbursed to Borrower upon receipt of the Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit).
During the existence of a Cash Sweep Period, on every third Payment Date occurring after the date the Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit is deposited with Lender until the face amount of the Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit is equal to the Rollover Reserve Cap, Borrower shall cause the face amount of the Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit to be increased by an amount equal to $1.00 multiplied by the then existing aggregate net leasable area of the Property, divided by 4.
In no event shall any such increase cause the face amount of the Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit to be larger than the Rollover Reserve Cap.
Borrower shall cause the Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit to be reissued or amended within ten (10) days following each such recalculation to reflect the increased amount thereof.
Such Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit shall be issued by an issuer and otherwise in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Lender, Lender agreeing that KeyBank National Association is an acceptable issuer of such Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit.
The Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit (a) shall be obtained by an “applicant” that is not the Borrower, (b)
shall provide that it is transferable by Lender and its successors at no cost to them, and that the issuer of such a letter of credit will look solely to parties other than Lender for any transfer costs or fees, (c) shall provide for partial draws thereon, (d) shall be payable by sight draft only and shall not include any requirements or conditions for draws other than Lender’s demand therefor, and (e)
shall have a term expiring not earlier than thirteen (13) months from the date of its issuance.
Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date of the Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit then held by Lender hereunder, Borrower shall deposit with Lender
a replacement Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit complying with the requirements of this paragraph or provide Lender with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that the expiration date of the existing Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit has been extended an additional twelve (12) months.
Borrower’s failure to provide to Lender such replacement or extension as required by the immediately prior sentence shall allow Lender to draw the entire remaining proceeds thereof and deposit the same in the Rollover Reserve Account.
The Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit and all proceeds thereof shall be deemed part of the Reserve Funds, and shall be held in escrow by Lender according to the terms of this Agreement.
Borrower will pay all costs associated with the initial issuance, any modification or re-issuance of the Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit, now or in the future, in connection with any transfer of the Loan by Lender, in connection with any Securitization or otherwise.
Upon such transfer, Borrower agrees that Lender is released from all liability in respect of the Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit, and that Borrower shall look solely to the transferee with respect to all matters relating to the Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit.
In the event that all then existing Cash Sweep Events have been cured during a period wherein Lender is in possession of the Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit, Lender will promptly return the Rollover Reserve Letter of Credit to Borrower within five (5) Business Days following Lender’s acceptance of Borrower’s cure.

(d)           Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written consent of Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in any Reserve Fund or the monies deposited therein or permit any lien or encumbrance to attach thereto, or any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC-1 Financing Statements, except those naming Lender as the secured party, to be filed with respect thereto.
 
(e)           Lender and Servicer shall not be liable for any loss sustained on the investment of any funds constituting the Reserve Funds.
Borrower shall indemnify Lender and Servicer and hold Lender and Servicer harmless from and against any and all actions, suits, claims and demands and actual out-of-pocket liabilities, losses, damages (
excluding, in all events, consequential, punitive, special, exemplary and indirect damages), obligations and costs and expenses (including litigation costs and reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees and expenses) arising from or in any way connected with the Reserve Funds or the performance of the obligations for which the Reserve Funds were established.
Borrower shall assign to Lender

Section 7.7           Major Tenant Rollover Reserve.
 
7.7.1       Deposits to Major Tenant Rollover Reserve Fund.
During a Cash Sweep Period caused by a Major Tenant Trigger Event, Borrower shall deposit or cause to be deposited with Lender all Excess Cash Flow to the extent provided herein and in the Cash Management Agreement, which amounts
shall be held by Lender for tenant improvement and leasing commission obligations incurred in connection with the leasing of any or all of the Major Tenant Premises.
Amounts so deposited, and, if applicable, any amount so deposited resulting from a draw on the DSCR/Tenant Cure – Letter of Credit, shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Major Tenant Rollover Reserve Fund” and the account to which such amounts are held shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Major Tenant Rollover Reserve Account”.
Borrower shall also pay to Lender, for deposit into the Major Tenant Rollover Reserve Account, all Lease Termination Payments in connection with or related to any Major Tenant Lease.
Notwithstanding the aforementioned, deposits to the Major Tenant Rollover Reserve Fund shall not cause the aggregate amount of the Major Tenant Rollover Reserve Fund to exceed the then applicable Major Tenant Rollover Reserve Cap on any Payment Date and accordingly, to the extent any such required deposit would result in the aggregate amount of Major Tenant Rollover Reserve Funds in the Major Tenant Rollover Reserve Account exceeding the Major Tenant Rollover Reserve Cap, such deposit shall be decreased by an amount equal to such excess.
 
7.7.2       Withdrawal of Major Tenant Rollover Reserve Fund.
Provided no Event of Default hereunder exists and is then continuing, Lender shall make disbursements from the Major Tenant Rollover Reserve Fund for TILC Obligations incurred by Borrower in connection with the leasing of any Major Tenant Premises using the same disbursement requirements and procedures as set forth herein for disbursements from the Rollover Reserve Fund.
Additionally, so long as no Event of Default or other uncured Cash Sweep Event then exists, upon the occurrence of a Cash Sweep Event Cure with respect to all then existing Major Tenant Trigger Events (but excepting a Cash Sweep Event Cure based upon the Major Tenant Rollover Reserve Funds being equal to the Major Tenant Rollover Reserve Cap), any funds in the Major Tenant Rollover Reserve Account shall be disbursed to Borrower.
Any Major Tenant Rollover Reserve Funds remaining after the Debt has been paid in full shall be paid to Borrower.

Section 8.2           Remedies.
(a)
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, all or any one or more of the rights, powers, privileges and other remedies available to Lender against Borrower under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents executed and delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower or at law or in equity may be exercised by Lender at any time and from time to time, whether or not all or any of the Debt shall be declared due and payable, and whether or not Lender shall have commenced any foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its rights and remedies under any of the Loan Documents with respect to all or any part of the Property.
Any such actions taken by Lender shall be cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued independently, singularly, successively, together or otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may determine in its discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by law, without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of Lender permitted by law, equity or contract or as set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower agrees that if an Event of Default is continuing (i) Lender is not subject to any “one action” or “election of remedies” law or rule, and (ii)
all liens and other rights, remedies or privileges provided to Lender shall remain in full force and effect until Lender has exhausted all of its remedies against the Property and the Security Instruments have been foreclosed, sold or otherwise realized upon in satisfaction of the Debt or
the Debt has been paid in full.
 
107
 
 
(b)           
With respect to Borrower and the Property, nothing contained herein or in any other Loan Document shall be construed as requiring Lender to resort to any Individual Property for the satisfaction of any of the Debt in any preference or priority to any other Individual Property, and Lender may seek satisfaction out of all of the Properties, or any part thereof, in its discretion in respect of the Debt.
In addition, Lender shall have the right from time to time to partially foreclose the Security Instruments in any manner and for any amounts secured by the Security Instruments then due and payable as determined by Lender in its discretion including the following circumstances: (i) in the event
Borrower defaults beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of one or more scheduled payments of principal and interest
, Lender may foreclose one or more of the Security Instruments to recover such delinquent payments or (ii) in the event Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire outstanding principal balance of the Loan, Lender may foreclose one or more of the Security Instruments to recover so much of the principal balance of the Loan as Lender may accelerate and such other sums secured by one or more of the Security Instruments as Lender may elect.
Notwithstanding one or more partial foreclosures, the Properties shall remain subject to the Security Instruments to secure payment of sums secured by the Security Instruments and not previously recovered.
 
(c)            
If an Event of Default exists, Lender shall have the right to sever the Note and the other Loan Documents into one or more separate notes, mortgages and other security documents (the “Severed Loan Documents”) in such denominations as Lender shall determine in its discretion for purposes of evidencing and enforcing its rights and remedies provided hereunder.
Borrower shall execute and deliver to Lender from time to time, promptly after the request of Lender, a severance agreement and such other documents as Lender shall request in order to effect the severance described in the preceding sentence, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender.
Borrower hereby absolutely and irrevocably appoints Lender as its true and lawful attorney, coupled with an interest, in its name and stead to make and execute all documents necessary or desirable to effect the aforesaid severance, Borrower ratifying all that its said attorney shall do by virtue thereof; provided, however
, Lender shall not make or execute any such documents under such power until three (3) Business Days after notice has been given to Borrower by Lender of Lender’s
intent to exercise its rights under such power.
Borrower shall be obligated to pay any costs or expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution, recording or filing of the Severed Loan Documents and the Severed Loan Documents shall not contain any representations, warranties or covenants not contained in the Loan Documents and any such representations and warranties contained in the Severed Loan Documents will be given by Borrower only as of the Closing Date and no Severed Loan Documents shall increase in any manner Borrower’s obligations, decrease Borrower’s rights or modify in a manner adverse to Borrower any financial obligations of Borrower.
 
(d)           As used in this Section 8.2, a “foreclosure” shall include, without limitation, any sale by power of sale.
 
108
 
 
Section 8.3           Remedies Cumulative; Waivers.
The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which Lender may have against Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise.
Lender’s rights, powers and remedies may be pursued singularly, concurrently or otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may determine in Lender’s discretion.
No delay or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event of Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient.
A waiver of one Default or Event of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by Borrower or to impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.
 
ARTICLE IX - SPECIAL PROVISIONS
 
Section 9.1            Securitization.
 
9.1.1       Sale of Notes and Securitization.

(b)           
At the request of Lender, and to the extent not already required to be provided by or on behalf of Borrower under this Agreement, Borrower shall, at no cost or expenses to Borrower, use reasonable efforts to provide information not in the possession of Lender or which may be reasonably required by Lender or take other actions reasonably required by Lender, in each case in order to satisfy the market standards to which Lender customarily adheres or which may be reasonably required by investors or prospective investors or the Rating Agencies in connection with any such Securitization.

Borrower agrees that each of Borrower, Guarantor and their respective officers and representatives, shall, at no cost or expense to Borrower at Lender’s request, cooperate with Lender’s efforts to arrange for a Securitization in accordance with the market standards to which Lender customarily adheres and/or which may be required by prospective investors or the Rating Agencies in connection with any such Securitization, provided that Borrower shall not be required to increase in any manner Borrower’s obligations, decrease Borrower’s rights or modify in a manner adverse to Borrower any financial obligations of Borrower.
Borrower and Guarantor agree to review, at Lender’s request in connection with the Securitization, the Disclosure Documents as such Disclosure Documents relate to Borrower, Guarantor, the Property and the Loan, including, the sections entitled “Risk Factors,” “Special Considerations,” “Description of the Security Instrument,” “Description of the Mortgage Loan and Mortgaged Property,” “The Manager,” “The Borrower,” and “Certain Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loan,” and shall confirm that the factual statements and representations contained in such sections and such other information in the Disclosure Documents (to the extent such information relates to, or is based on, or includes any information regarding the Property, Borrower, Guarantor, Manager or the Loan)
do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(i)             
Borrower agrees, at no cost or expense to Borrower, to make upon Lender’s written request, without limitation, all structural or other changes to the Loan (including delivery of one or more new component notes to replace the original note or modify the original note to reflect multiple components of the Loan and such new notes or modified note may have different interest rates and amortization schedules), modifications to any documents evidencing or securing the Loan, creation of one or more mezzanine loans (including amending Borrower’s organizational structure to provide for one or more mezzanine borrowers), delivery of opinions of counsel acceptable to the Rating Agencies or potential investors and addressing such matters as the Rating Agencies or potential investors may require; provided, however, that in creating such new notes or modified notes or mezzanine notes Borrower shall not be required to modify

the aggregate amortization of principal of the Note, (D) any other material economic term of the Loan, (E) decrease the time periods during which Borrower is permitted to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents, or (F)

In connection with the foregoing, Borrower covenants and agrees to modify the Cash Management Agreement to reflect the newly created components or mezzanine loans.
 
(ii)           
Without limiting the foregoing, Borrower agrees that upon Lender
’s request that the respective original principal amounts of Note A-1, Note A-2, Note A-3, Note A-4, Note A-5, Note A-6, Note A-7 and Note A-8 be revised in connection with a Securitization (provided that such revisions shall not change the aggregate principal balance of such Notes or modify any of its terms set forth in clauses (c)(i)(A) – (F) above), Borrower shall complete the following actions within five (5) Business Days following Lender’s written request therefor:

(B)           
If requested by Lender, Borrower shall cause its respective counsel to issue supplemental or replacement legal opinions in the form of such counsel
’s opinion delivered as of the closing of the Loan with respect to the replacement Notes.
 
(d)           If requested by Lender, Borrower shall provide, at no cost or expense to Borrower, Lender, promptly upon request, with any financial statements, or financial, statistical or operating information, as Lender reasonably shall determine to be required pursuant to Regulation AB under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or any amendment, modification or replacement thereto or other legal requirements in connection with any private placement memorandum, prospectus or other disclosure documents or any filing pursuant to the Exchange Act in connection with the Securitization or as shall otherwise be reasonably requested by Lender.
 
110
 
 
(e)            Borrower hereby appoints Lender its attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution (which appointment shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest and to be irrevocable until the Loan is paid and the Security Instrument is discharged of record, with Borrower hereby ratifying all that its said attorney shall do by virtue thereof) to execute and deliver all documents and do all other acts and things necessary or desirable to effect any Securitization authorized hereunder;
provided, however, that unless an Event of Default exists, Lender shall not execute or deliver any such documents or do any such acts or things under such power.
 
9.1.2       Securitization Costs.
All reasonable third party costs and expenses incurred by Borrower and Guarantor in connection with Borrower’s compliance with this Section 9.1 (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of the Rating Agencies, attorneys’ fees, mortgage recording tax and title insurance premiums) shall be paid by Lender.
 
Section 9.2           
Right To Release Information.
Following the occurrence of any Event of Default, Lender may forward to any broker, prospective purchaser of any Individual Property or the Loan, or other person or entity all documents and information which Lender now has or may hereafter acquire relating to the Debt, Borrower, any Guarantor, any indemnitor, any Individual Property and any other matter in connection with the Loan, whether furnished by Borrower, any Guarantor, any indemnitor or otherwise, as Lender reasonably determines necessary or desirable.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, each party comprising Borrower further waives any right to a fair value hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 580a, or any other similar law, to determine the size of any deficiency owing (for which such party comprising Borrower would be liable hereunder) following a non-judicial foreclosure sale.
Without limiting the foregoing or anything else contained in this Agreement, each party comprising Borrower waives all rights and defenses that such party may have because the Loan is secured by real property.
This means, among other things:
 
(1)            that Lender may collect from such party without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by any other Borrower; and
 
(2)            if Lender forecloses on any real property collateral pledged by any other Borrower: (x) the amount of the Loan may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price; and (y) Lender may collect from such party even if Lender, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, has destroyed any right such party may have to collect from any other Borrower.
 
This paragraph is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses that each party comprising Borrower may have because the Loan is secured by real property.
These rights and defenses include, but are not limited to, any rights or defenses based upon Sections 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.
 
(c)            
Each party comprising Borrower hereby agrees that it will not enforce any of its rights of contribution or subrogation against any other party comprising Borrower with respect to any liability incurred by it hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, any payments made by it to Lender with respect to any of the Obligations or any collateral security until such time as all of the Obligations have been paid in full.
Any claim which any party comprising Borrower may have against any other party comprising Borrower with respect to any payments to Lender are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of payment, including, without limitation as to any increases in the Obligations arising under this Agreement, to the prior payment in full in cash of the Obligations and, in the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding under the laws of any jurisdiction relating to any party comprising Borrower, its debts or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be paid in full in cash before any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to any other Borrower.
 
124
 
 
(d)           Nothing contained in this Section shall limit the liability of any party comprising Borrower to pay extensions of credit made directly or indirectly to such party, Obligations relating to Letters of Credit issued to support such party’s business, and all accrued interest, fees, expenses and other related Obligations with respect thereto, for which such party shall be primarily liable for all purposes hereunder.
